## Load assets and resources

If you want to link to static files in your project or stories (e.g. /fonts/XYZ.woff), use the -s path/to/folder to specify a static folder to serve from when you start up Storybook. To do so, edit the storybook and build-storybook scripts in package.json.

We recommend serving external resources and assets requested in your components statically with Storybook. This ensures that assets are always available to your stories.
